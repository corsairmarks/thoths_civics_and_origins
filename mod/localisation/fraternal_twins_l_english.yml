 START_SCREEN_FRATERNAL_TWINS: "From the moment we [GetSpeciesName] first looked to the stars, we knew we were not alone.\n\nOf all the spheres in the heavens, one fascinated us like no other. Its faint resemblance to [GetHomeWorldName] inspired countless tales of otherworldly beings, long before spaceflight was possible. When our astronomers spotted lights on its dark side, these tales were all but confirmed. We quickly developed remote communication, and before long our messages were answered. Though it took many diplomatic hurdles to overcome, our two species have united as one civilization.\n\nNow, after the discovery of the hyperlane network, the finest minds of both worlds have finished development of the first [GetStartingDrivePlural]. Together, we journey into the great unknown, whoever we may find out there."

Its faint resemblance to [GetHomeWorldName] made it a highly probable location for another species to arise. As our technology advanced, these suspicions were confirmed when our drones spotted lights on its dark side. Reaching deeper into subspace than ever before, we sent a message of greeting to any consciousness beyond our world. Before long our calls were answered, and after years of intense focus our consciousnesses have merged into a singular being.\n\nNow, after the discovery of the hyperlane network, the finest minds of [GetName] have finished development of the first [GetStartingDrivePlural]. Together, we grow into the great unknown, whatever we may find out there."
