A dumb little mod with stuff I've made. So far it contains 1Â½ new origins and one trait, with more to come (hopefully.)

* Fraternal Twins - Start with a secondary species and a second homeworld in your system. Comes with a gestalt version!
* Kleptoplastic - a lite version of Phototrophic for species who aren't plants or fungi. Mostly for roleplay purposes.

Special credit to corsairmarks for writing most of Fraternal Twins' code in his spare time.

## Changelog

* 0.3.0 Initial version

### Development Notes

It is best to clone this repository into `<Stellaris User's Directory>/Paradox Interactive/Stellaris/mod`, and then make a connection to the `mod` folder via a `*.mod` file's `path` property.  That will ensure the game can see the files, and also that CWTools will parse them.  Also note that the README.md file exists in the `mod` directory but is symbolically linked in the root directory.
