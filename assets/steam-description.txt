A dumb little mod with stuff I've made. So far it contains 1Â½ new origins and one trait, with more to come (hopefully.)

[list]
[*]Fraternal Twins - Start with a secondary species and a second homeworld in your system. Comes with a gestalt version!
[*]Kleptoplastic - a lite version of Phototrophic for species who aren't plants or fungi. Mostly for roleplay purposes.
[/list]

Special credit to corsairmarks for writing most of Fraternal Twins' code in his spare time.
